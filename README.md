# healpix
C# port of Typescript implementation of [HEALPix](https://healpix.sourceforge.io/) ([paper [pdf]](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1086/427976/pdf))

## Introduction

This module is port of [Typescript implementation](https://github.com/michitaro/healpix) by  [Koike Michitaro](https://github.com/michitaro). Effort was put into making code as similar to Typescript implementation as possible including naming and ordering of methods. There was some difficulty porting number type into ints and doubles leading to some numerical issuess but overall it should work.

## Installation

NuGet package is available:

`dotnet add package Healpix`

## TODO
